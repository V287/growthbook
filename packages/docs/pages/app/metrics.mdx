# Metrics

Metrics are what your experiments are trying to optimize.  Growth Book has a very flexible and powerful way to define metrics.

## Conversion Types

Metrics can have different statistical distributions. Below are the ones Growth Book supports:

| Conversion Type | Description                               | Example                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| binomial        | A simple yes/no conversion                | Created Account          |
| count           | Counts multiple conversions per user      | Pages per Visit          |
| duration        | How much time something takes on average  | Time on Site             |
| revenue         | The revenue gained/lost on average        | Revenue per User         |

## Query settings

For metrics to work, you need to tell Growth Book how to query the data from your data source. There are 2 ways to do this:

### 1. SQL (recommended)

If your data source supports SQL, this is the preferred way to define metrics. You can use joins, subselects, or anything else supported by your SQL dialect.

Your SELECT statement should return one row per "conversion event". This may be a page view, a purchase, a session, or something else.

Example:
```sql
SELECT
  user_id as user_id,
  anon_id as anonymous_id,
  amount as value,
  received_at as timestamp
FROM
  purchases
```

Binomial metrics don't need a `value` column (the existence of a row means the user converted).

Also, your metric may only support logged-in or anonymous users, in which case you can omit the other type of id.

For example, a binomial metric that only supports logged-in users would look like this:

```sql
SELECT
  user_id as user_id,
  received_at as timestamp
FROM
  registrations
```

### 2. Query Builder (legacy)

The query builder prompts you for things such as table/column names and constructs a query behind the scenes.

For non-SQL data sources (e.g. Google Analytics, Mixpanel), this is the only option. Otherwise, if you data sources supports it, inputting raw SQL is easier and more flexible.
